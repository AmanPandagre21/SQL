## ER Diagram
An Entity Relationship Diagram is a diagram that represents relationships among entities in a database. It is commonly known as an ER Diagram.

## What is an ER Model?
 
An Entity-Relationship Model represents the structure of the database with the help of a diagram. ER Modelling is a systematic process to design a database as it would require you to analyze all data requirements before implementing your database.

## Symbols Used in ER Diagrams
- Rectangles: This Entity Relationship Diagram symbol represents entity types
- Ellipses: This symbol represents attributes
- Diamonds: This symbol represents relationship types
- Lines: It links attributes to entity types and entity types with other relationship types
- Primary key: Here, it underlines the attributes 
- Double Ellipses: Represents multi-valued attributes


 ### Components of ER Diagram
You base an ER Diagram on three basic concepts:

 #### Entities
 An entity can be either a living or non-living component.

- Multivalued Attribute => Some attributes can possess over one value, those attributes are called multivalued attributes.

- Derived Attribute => An attribute that can be derived from other attributes of the entity is known as a derived attribute.
